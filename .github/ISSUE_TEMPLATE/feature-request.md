Hi there!

Thank you for contributing to the p5.js project

Until further notice, we will only add new features that increase access.

In order to request a new feature for p5.js, we need to know how the new feature will increase access, and also what is its sub-area.

To check an option in the sub-areas list, replace the "[ ]" with a "[x]". Be sure to check out how it looks in the Preview tab! Feel free to remove any portion of the template that is not relevant for your issue.
