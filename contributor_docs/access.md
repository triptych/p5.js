# Our Focus on Access

At the [2019 Contributors Conference](https://p5js.org/community/contributors-conference-2019.html), we made a commitment to only add features to p5.js that increase access (meaning inclusion and/or accessibility). This means considering the vectors of diversity (e.g. gender, social, economic, race, ethnicity, language, disability, etc.) that can impact access/participation; and taking action to acknowledge, dismantle, and prevent barriers. We prioritize the needs of historically marginalized groups over the continued comfort of more privileged groups with p5.js.

We will not accept feature requests that don't support our effort to increase access. You'll see this criteria reflected in our issue and pull request templates.

This is part of an ongoing conversation about access and inclusion within p5.js. Our intention to hold these as core values from which p5.js is built is laid out in our [Community Statement](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which was written at the [2015 Contributors Conference](https://p5js.org/community/contributors-conference-2015.html).

**Please consider this a starting point.** We want to invite more conversations about what access means and how we can prioritize it.

## Kinds of access

Increasing access is not a focus on expanding the raw number of people in the p5.js community. It is a focus on making p5.js available to and approachable for people who are excluded from the p5.js community (intentionally or not) and from similar tools and communities.

Access here means making p5.js better for:

- People who speak languages other than English
- Black people, Indigenous peoples, and People of Color
- People who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, or queer
- People with marginalized genders
- People with disabilities or illness
- People who lack opportunities and/or resources to engage with creative coding due to class or income
- People with little or no prior experience in open source and creative coding
- and other people who are systemically excluded and historically underrepresented

### Examples

These are examples of efforts we believe to increase access:

- Translating more documentation and other materials into more languages
- Improving our support for assistive technologies (such as screenreaders)
- Following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in our tools and working towards making it easier for users to follow them in their projects
- Making p5.js error messages more helpful and supportive to people using the tool
- Mentoring and supporting learners of p5.js within communities that are historically excluded from and marginalized in creative coding and the digital arts

There are other things we haven't thought of yet and we're excited to figure out what they are together. If you have an idea, please [share it as an issue](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/new/choose).

## Maintenance

We also affirm our intention to maintain the existing feature set of p5.js. We'd like to fix bugs regardless of which area of the codebase they're in because we believe consistency of the tool makes it more accessible for beginners.
